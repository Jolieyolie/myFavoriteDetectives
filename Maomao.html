      introduction: Maomao is a sharp-witted apothecary who once lived in the
      pleasure district before being forced into service at the imperial palace.
      Her deep knowledge of medicine and poisons, combined with her insatiable
      curiosity, makes her a brilliant investigator of palace mysteries and
      medical incidents. Despite her modest origins, Maomao’s intellect earns
      her recognition among the imperial elite.
