      <strong>Introduction:</strong> Inspector Morse is a cultured, melancholic
      detective with a love for classical music, literature, and ale. Working in
      Oxford, he relies on intuition and intellect rather than forensic
      evidence. Known for his complex personality and moral depth, Morse’s
      investigations often reveal the darker sides of human nature.
