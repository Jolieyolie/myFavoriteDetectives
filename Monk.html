      <strong>Introduction:</strong> Adrian Monk is a former San Francisco
      police detective who becomes a private consultant after the tragic death
      of his wife. Struggling with severe obsessive-compulsive disorder and
      multiple phobias, Monk uses his extraordinary observational skills and
      brilliant mind to solve complex cases that baffle others. His journey is
      as much about solving crimes as it is about coping with his personal
      challenges and seeking closure regarding his wife's death.
